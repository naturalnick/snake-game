## Summary

Snake is a simple game involving a "snake" and an "apple". The snake is represented by a black line. The apple is represented by a green dot.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the canvas, but if you crash into the walls or yourself, it's game over. When you collect apples, you gain a point and extend the length of the snake by one.

This was a super fun game to make. I learned a whole lot about objects, HTML canvas, and calculating positioning.

The logic in this was very tricky and I had to step away a few times and just use a pen and paper to figure it out.
