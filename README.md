## Summary

Snake is a simple game involving a "snake" and an "apple".

Use the arrow keys to navigate the canvas, but if you crash into the walls or yourself, you lose.

Collect apples to gain length and points.

This was a super fun game to make. I learned a whole lot about objects, HTML canvas, and calculating positioning.
